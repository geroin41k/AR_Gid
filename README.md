This repository demonstrates a simple HTML page using Photo Sphere Viewer v5. It loads panorama images without any backend server.

Open `index.html` directly in a browser to see the panorama with an example hotspot.
You can also click anywhere on the panorama to drop a temporary marker. Its coordinates
will appear in the browser console and the marker disappears after a few seconds.
